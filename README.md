# Clean Text

If you copy text, for example from a PDF, every line of text in a paragraph will be copied as a break line, instead of a continous line.

If there are 2 paragraphs, the website maybe will mantain the break line between the two of them (depend on the PDF's text).

In other words:

1. Original text in a PDF:

```
Broad scientific consensus exists that human activity is
causing climate change, primarily through fossil fuel.

A rapid transition from fossil fuels to
renewables has been widely advocated.
```

2. Without the break line after the `activity is`

```
Broad scientific consensus exists that human activity is causing climate change, primarily through fossil fuel.
A rapid transition from fossil fuels to renewables has been widely advocated.
```
